All the image processing used in this project is based on structural brain templates. \r\n\r\nThe currently available version of RelaxoPhantom toolkit is relaxophantom-v1.1.0, which provides:\r\n\r\n* Relaxometry dataset for T2 and T1 images with different noise levels and RF distortions (please see the script phantom-build.sh for more details)\r\n* Phantoms with 1 mm3 of spatial resolution is available\r\n* Rician noise with 0%, 3% and 9% are available and Radio-frequency coil artifact with 0%, 20% and 40% are available for the phantom reconstructions\r\n\r\nTo see a simple example of the image data that is created, please download a [relaxometry sample](https://github.com/acsenrafilho/relaxophantom/raw/gh-pages/images/MNI152_T2_n3_rf20_slice_0081.nii). For this particular example, the slice selected is at the middle brain portion in slice 81 (MNI152). All the 180 slices in the MNI152 is reconstructed in RelaxoPhantom, given a three-dimensional brain relaxometry simulation.   \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nAs it is, the software needs FSL (5.0) previously installed on your machine. Please, be sure that FSL are installed and exist an environment variable called fsl5.0 in your system.\r\n\r\nTo check if exist a link for FSL in your machine type\r\n\r\n`whereis fsl5.0`\r\n\r\nin a terminal and certificate that FSL 5.0 is already installed in your machine.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have FSL installed, you can download it (actually, the FSL-5.0 version) directly from [official FSL website](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation). To know more about FSL, see more information about it [here](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/). The FSL software has a GNU license. Please check it before use it for any purposes. We do not have any responsibility for any problem or bad functioning of the code.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nSimply download this repository (.zip or .tar.gz compress files present on the top o this web page) and run the script **phantom-build.sh**. The default image parameters are placed in this main script. If you want to change the parameters in order to create a different simulated brain objects, you can change it in the header section in the **phantom-build.sh** file. Please, choose those parameters wisely.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Make sure that the _.sh_ files have permission to execute. You can change the permission parameters simply typing \r\n\r\n`chmod a+x <script file>` \r\n\r\nin your terminal. This terminal command allows the program execution.\r\n\r\n## Problems, Bugs and Suggestions\r\n\r\nThis project is maintained by @acsenrafilho and if you have any problem, bug or suggestion, please contact me by my [email address](mailto:acsenrafilho@gmail.com).
