All the process is based on previously reconstructed brain phantoms by BrainWeb (Montreal Neurological Institute) project. See the McGill Neuroscience Institute (<http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/>) website to found out more information about the BrainWeb phantoms.\r\n\r\nThe version of Relaxo Phantom toolkit currently avaliable is relaxophantom-v1.0.1, which provides:\r\n\r\n* Relaxometry dataset for T2 images with different noise levels and RF distortions (please see the script phantom-build.sh for more details)\r\n* Only phantom with 1 mm^3 of spatial resolution is avaliable\r\n\r\nTo see how the image dataset is created, please download a [relaxometry sample](https://github.com/acsenrafilho/relaxophantom/raw/gh-pages/images/MNI152_T2_n3_rf20_slice_0081.nii). At this particular example, the slice selected is at the middle brain portion in slice 81 MNI152. All the 180 slices in the MNI152 is reconstructed in Relaxophantom.   \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nAs it is, the software needs FSL (5.0) previously installed on your machine. Please, be sure that FSL are installed and exist a environment variable called fsl5.0 in your system.\r\n\r\nTo check if exist a link for fsl in your machine type\r\n\r\n`whereis fsl5.0`\r\n\r\nin a terminal and certificate that FSL 5.0 is already installed in your machine.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have FSL installed, you can download the 5.0 version directly from [official FSL website](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation). To know more about FSL, see more information about it [here](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/).\r\n\r\nThe FSL software have a GNU licence, but check the licence first before use it for other purposes. We not have any responsibility for any problem or bad functioning of the code.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nSimply download this repository (.zip or .tar.gz compress files) and run the script phantom-build.sh. If you want to change the parameters in order to create a different simulated brain objects, you can change it in the header section in the phantom-build.sh file. Please, choose those parameters wisely.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Make sure that the _.sh_ files have permission to execute. If not, run \r\n\r\n`chmod a+x <script file>` \r\n\r\nto allow the exectution\r\n\r\n## Problems, Bugs and Suggestions\r\n\r\nThis project is maintained by @acsenrafilho and if you have any problem, bug or suggestion, please contact me by my [email address](mailto:acsenrafilho@gmail.com).
