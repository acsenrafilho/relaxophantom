All the process is based on previously reconstructed brain phantoms by BrainWeb (Montreal Neurological Institute) project. See the McGill Neuroscience Institute (<http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/>) website to found out more information about the BrainWeb phantoms.\r\n\r\nThe version of Relaxo Phantom toolkit currently avaliable is relaxophantom-v1.0.1, where it is already done:\r\n\r\n* Relaxometry for T2 images with different noise levels and RF distortions (please see the script phantom-build.sh for more details)\r\n* Only phantom with 1 mm3 of spatial resolution is avaliable\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nAs it is, the software needs FSL (5.0) previously installed on your machine. Please, be sure that FSL are installed and exist a enviroment variable called fsl5.0 in your system.\r\n\r\nTo check if exist a link for fsl in your machine type \"whereis fsl5.0\" in a terminal.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have FSL installed, you can download the 5.0 version directly from  <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation>. \r\nTo know more about FSL, see more information about it [here](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/).\r\n\r\nThis program have a GNU licence, but check first the FSL licence before use it for other purposes. We not have any responsibility for any problem or bad function of the code.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nSimply download this repository and run the script phantom-build.sh. If you want to change the parameters in order to create different simulated brain objects, you can change it in the header section in the phantom-build.sh file. Please, choose those parameters wisely.\r\n\r\nNote: Make sure that the .sh files have permission to execute. (If not, run chmod a+x 'script' to allow the exectution).\r\n\r\n## Problems, Bugs and Suggestions\r\n\r\nThis project is maintained by @acsenrafilho and if you have any problem, bug or suggestion, please contact me by my [email address](mailto:acsenrafilho@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
