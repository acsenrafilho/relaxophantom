# Relaxophantom - Relaxometry Phantom Generator

## Description

This software aims to reconstruct brain relaxometry T1 and T2 phantom images based on a well structured anatomical brain model (MNI152). Please see the Reference section to correctly cite the project.

Remember that this is an open-source project under GNU license. Your are free to download, use, share and develop with other people. If any trouble occur in the reconstruction process, please send me an [email](mailto:acsenrafilho@gmail.com).   

## How to use

Simply download this repository (.zip or .tar.gz formats), extract it on a desired folder path, and run the script **phantom-build**. If you want to change the simulation parameters, simply change the header section in the **phantom-build** script file. You can edit it on any text editor, such as Notepad or Gedit. Please, choose those parameters wisely.

**Note**: Make sure that the script files have permission to execute. To make sure of it, you can change the file permissions using the following terminal command: 

`chmod u+x <script>`

Where `<script>` is the script file that you want to change the permissions.
